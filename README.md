Project:  Photography website

I wanted to use many of the elements that we learned thoughout the Bootcamp course to this website to reinforce my learning.  I will continue to work on this
and hope to eventually build a creative website for my photography business.

I wanted to create several photo galleries to use for portfolio examples and for client galleries.  I had a lot of difficulty creating the galleries and ended up with a simple grid
gallery with images loaded into an images folder.
